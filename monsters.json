I will reveal your weakness, wretched mortal.\"\n\nA Celestial Commander. These valorous angels were created to punish the wicked and ensure the sincerity of the penitent. When Maligant called his heavenly hosts in the war of the Four Divines, the angels marshaled out with the other upper echelons under the command of the Arch Seraph Empyreus. When Aurelia sacrificed herself and revealed the madness of the war, the Angels fought on, refusing to admit that they were part of a calamitous tragedy, seeing surrender as tantamount to blasphemy. With the zeal of a censorious bureaucratic tyrant, they now wage a guerilla war with a piecemeal retinue of veteran battle angels, zealots, fanatic paladins, cohorts of penitent levies, and volunteer convert militia auxiliaries as part of an anti-corruption peasant revolt in the hinterland of Altenheim.\n\nFiendish Temptation. Each Angel keeps a copper cage under a velveteen cover inside a lead box encased in blessed orichalcum on a thick chain around its neck. In the cage is a pathetic, impish fiend of Malikir, withered like a raisin. The creature has an uncanny knack for teasing out corruption and compelling wicked behavior in mortals. It only takes moments to get a confession once a weak-willed mortal has revealed their true self in the presence of the fiend.\n\nA Corrupted Temperance. An Angel of Empyreus uses its original orders as a pretext for further violence. It will never surrender. Surrender is a trick of the enemy. It must fulfill its purpose: to root out corruption and sin, and it will do anything to find sin in mortal hearts. The imp claims to put mortals to the test, and the Angel knows what it is doing. It won’t kill the imp, as using the imp reveals the innate corruption in mortal souls.\"",

To attune to it, a paladin character must agree to carry on the angel’s mission to cleanse the land of immorality.

The Arcanist Inquisition exists to detain and destroy arcane spellcasters. Inquisitors believe that arcane magic is inherently corrupting and that even the best-intentioned spellcaster can succumb to dangerous behavior and moral ruin. At first, the inquisition’s masters sought to monitor spellcasters, with detainment reserved for those who abused their magical gifts. Over time, the ideology became more hardline. Now, inquisitors put spellcasters whom they don’t imprison indefinitely to the fire.\n\nInquisitors train to discover mages, but they don’t rely only on their acumen. Folks fearful of being accused are happy to point a finger at a suspicious neighbor if doing so focuses the inquisition’s interest elsewhere.\n\nDogma Bound. The Arcanist Inquisition is known for its ongoing efforts to eradicate arcane magic and its practitioners. However, it also investigates other crimes against the edicts of the Arch Seraphs.
